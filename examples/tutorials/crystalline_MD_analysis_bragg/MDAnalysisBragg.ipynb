    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, were going to be using dataset produced from a crystalline MD simulation of _protein kinase A_. This data will be used to reproduce some of the findings from our paper, published in _Acta Crystallographica Section D_ entitled \"[Molecular Dynamics Simulation Methods for Macromolecular Crystallography](https://journals.iucr.org/d/issues/2023/01/00/lp5065/)\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Refining a structural model against data computed from an MD simulation of a crystalline protein system.\n",
    "- Analyzing the B-factors from the simulated trajectory, and the model refined against the MD data (with some caveats concerning restrained and unrestrained simulation).\n",
    "- Reverse propagating a supercell simulation frame to produce a protein structural ensemble that can be used to complement the Bragg analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## Processing a MD trajectory for Bragg and diffuse analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In the notebook `Preparation_of_MD_Simulations_of_Protein_Crystals.ipynb` in the `crystalline_MD_prep/` directory, we showed how to prepare a protein crystal `.pdb` file from a `.pdb` of the asymmetric unit crystal structure, solvate and neutralize the system, and bring the system up to atmospheric pressure through iterative rounds of solvation and equilibration before running production simulation. Once one has a production simulation trajectory in hand (e.g. `production.xtc`), there are a few steps one must take before the trajectory can be used to calculate simulated diffuse scattering data.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, one needs to construct a `reference_structure.pdb` file. To serve as a reference, this file needs to contain the exact coordinates for the protein after propagation to a supercell. However, as the system is solvated, equilibrated, and simulated in production the coordinates are periodic-boundary corrected, so atoms which lie outside of the periodic box are mapped to the other side of the box according to the periodic boundary conditions. This means that, over the course of solvation, equilibration, and production, the coordinates of the protein can be mapped very far from their positions in the original propagated supercell structure. Also, due to errors in floating point arithmetic, over the course of the trajectory, the coordinates of the atoms can drift from their initial positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To correct for both of of these effects, one must use the coordiantes of the initial propagated structure as a reference, fit the trajectory to these intial positions, and correct for the periodic boundary corrections, so the dynamics of the trajectory represent the lattice and internal motions of the system, and not articats of the simulation procedure itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make such a reference structure, one must create a `.pdb` file with the atoms/coordinates from the initial propagated crystal structure, and the solvent atoms from the start of production (to ensure there are the same number of water/ion atoms in the reference structure as the production simulation).\n",
    "\n",
    "The file should be constructed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "`reference_structure.pdb`\n",
    "```\n",
    "CRYST1 ... ... ... <-- the CRYST1 record from the propagated supercell\n",
    "ATOM ... |\n",
    "ATOM ... | <-- coordinates from the original propagated supercell\n",
    "ATOM ... |\n",
    "TER\n",
    "ATOM ... |\n",
    "ATOM ... | <- coordinates of the solvent atoms from the end of\n",
    "ATOM ... | <- equilibration or the start of production\n",
    "ATOM ... |\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note, again: It is very important that the protein coordinates should be the coordinates of the initial propagated supercell, and there should be an equal number of atoms in this file as there are in the production simulation. `GROMACS` will not be able to process the trajectory correctly otherwise. It is also important that all the molecules in the reference structure are in the same ordered as the molecules in the `.gro` file outputted at the start of production simulation, or exported using `gmx dump -s production.tpr -f production.xtc -o starting_structure_system.pdb -dump 0`; if they are not in the same order, `GROMACS` will not be able to process the trajectory correctly.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Periodic Boundary Correction**\n",
    "    - `gmx trjconv -s reference_structure.pdb -f production.xtc -o production_pbc_mol.xtc -pbc mol`\n",
    "        - Maps atoms across the periodic boundary so that molecules are kept whole for the entire trajectory\n",
    "    - `gmx trjconv -s reference_structure.pdb -f production_pbc_mol.xtc -o production_pbc_mol_nojump.xtc -pbc nojump`\n",
    "        - Eliminates jumps from one side of the box to the other caused by the center of mass of the molecule crossing the periodic boundary.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- **Trajectory Fitting**\n",
    "    - `echo \"C-alpha System\" | gmx trjconv -s reference_structure.pdb -f production_pbc_mol_nojump.xtc -o production_pbc_mol_nojump_fit.xtc -fit translation`\n",
    "        - Minimizes the distance between the alpha carbons in the reference structure and the corresponding alpha carbons in the trajectory by translations, so protein atoms in all frames of the full trajectory are fit to the reference structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Downsampling and Subsampling**\n",
    "    - `gmx trjconv -s reference_structure.pdb -f production_pbc_mol_nojump_fit.xtc -o trajectory.xtc -skip [number of frames to skip] -b [beginning (ps)] -e [end (ps)]`\n",
    "        - skips a certain number of frames to downsample (e.g. if the original time step was 2 ps, `-skip 5` would produce a trajectory with 10 ps sampling). This step is important as trajectories can be very large and very long, so downsampling allows diffuse scattering to be calculated in a reasonable amount of time.\n",
    "        - Only outputs the portion of the trajectory from `beginning` to `end` ps. This step is important, as the ensemble sampled in simulation takes a certain amount of time to reach equilibrium (as measured by, e.g. RMSD to the crystal structure -- run `gmx rmsd -h` for information on how to calculate this for the trajectory, using the `reference_structure.pdb` as the reference), and one wants to calculate diffuse scattering only after the simulation has reached the equilibrium state.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Once the trajectory has been periodic-boundary-corrected, fit, and downsampled, `xtraj.py` can be used to calculated simulated diffuse scattering from the trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## Calculating mean structure factors and intensities from a crystalline MD trajectory\n",
    "\n",
    "The lunus script `xtraj.py` takes in a `GROMACS` `.xtc` trajectory file and a topology file (in the `.pdb` format) and computes the structure factors. To produce structure factors that can be compared with those from experiment, one needs to supply `unit_cell` and `space_group` information from the `CRYST1` record of the crystal structure, and the computed structure factors are transformed to match the structure of those that would be measured in experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `fcalc.mtz` and `iobs.mtz` files we will analyze below would require trajecory files that be too large to include in this directory, if we wished to have the user reproduce the whole data-processing pipeline, so we provide these files already processed. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, we provide an example `xtraj.py` call, using 50 frames of data from a trajetory from a 2x2x2 unit cell simulation of _protein kinase A_, so that the user can get a sense for how calls to `xtraj.py` should be structured. The `fcalc.mtz` files produced should not be used for analysis, but they can be analyzed in `coot` along with the the `starting_structure.pdb` file, if one wishes to get familiar with creating and analyzing the outputs of such calls. We provide these examples as a template that one can use to produce simulated Bragg data for their own simulations/systems."

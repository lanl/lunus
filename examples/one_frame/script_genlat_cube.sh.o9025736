After indexing on a subset of 900 spots (from all images), 196 were reclassified as
      either lying on the spindle, or potential overlapped spots or ice rings.

Of the remaining 704 spots, 3.8% were lattice outliers, leaving 677 well-fit spots
The outlier severity is 0.05 sigma [defined in J Appl Cryst (2010) 43, p.611 sec. 4].

Rerefinement on just the well-fit spots followed by spot reclassification
      leaves 675 good spots on which to calculate a triclinic rmsd.

LABELIT Indexing results:
Beam center x   39.87mm, y   42.55mm, distance   57.32mm ; 80% mosaicity=0.65 deg.
